#Univerally Unique User ID

This simple module provides a mechanism to set and retrieve IDs that are unique
to each site visitor. This module makes use of cookies.

UUUID was developed to provide a unique parameter to users for the anon token
module. But it has also been used, for example, with external APIs that require
each user to identified - whether or not they are logged in. In one case, the
external API stored information for the user. See GSAPI module on githib.
